A 3D maze is a maze where the player is enclosed inside a box. The player can move forward, backward, right, left, up or down. In this project I developed algorithms for generating and solving 3D mazes. The project also includes a web site where the user can play the maze game interactively.

3D Maze Project

Upon finishing our search problems unit our class was tasked with the assignment of generating and solving 3D mazes using various searching algorithms, such as Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search and A-Star Search. This unit also covered topics such as Iterative Deepening, Uniform Cost Search, Heuristics, Greedy Search and Dependency Injection. You can generate a maze with rows, columns and levels which you can toggle through as you search for the final cell (denoted with a 'G' for goal. You can also choose an algorithm for maze generation as well as an algorithm for solving the maze (BFS, DFS or A-Star). For my UI I decided to make it themed like the movie Tron with color schemes and font.
